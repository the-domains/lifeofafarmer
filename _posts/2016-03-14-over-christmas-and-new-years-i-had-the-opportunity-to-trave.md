  Over Christmas and New Years I had the opportunity to travel with my family to Belize. We got to explore the Mayan ruins, float rivers through caves, and climb our way back into a cave system called the ATM which sheltered pottery left by the Myan civilization. Along with all the culture and history we eventually made our way to the coast, staying on an island named Caye Caulker (pronounced ‘Key Call-ker’). On new years eve while diving I proposed to my now Fiance, Lynae! It was the perfect ending to our trip.
